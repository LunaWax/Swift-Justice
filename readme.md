# About Swift Justice

## Overview
**Swift Justice** is a cutting edge open-source project aimed at revolutionizing the rapidly developing Swift programming language by creating solutions and technologies unrivaled in their elegance and ingenuity. We're just not there yet.

## Our Mission
Like any open-source project, all we're really going for is making the world a better place without hurting anyone's feelings. But while we're at it, we might as well flip through the following things:

* Solve common 'gotcha' moments that chase people off Swift;
* Make things easier on Swift beginners tempered by JavaScript's profundity;
* Make Tesla and Elon Musk regret all the bad things they've said about Apple.

## Our Team
It's just me, but you're free to contribute and customize the $#!t out of any code you find here (which is not much anyway).

# Really, Though
To be peftectly honest, Swift Justice is just a collection (with one item in it, as of yet) of **Swift 3** code snippets and extensions that solve common "dahell?!" situations that people encounter when switching from languages like the majestic JavaScript to Swift.

I use those snippets to nail things StackOverflow wouldn't help me with, who says you can't use (and, hopefully, produce) them too!

# Licensing
Despite its immense commercial potential, Swift Justice has always been and always will be free to use, modify and distribute. At this point, it's hard to tell why anyone would do that, but still â€“ completely freefolk-style it is.
